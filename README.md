Community Deforesting Practices In the Pre-Colonial Settlement at
Millstone Bluff
Data Collection
What data will you collect or create?
Being an already extensively excavated site, Millstone Bluff should have some prior research
into tools, housing, hunting/gathering processes, etc. that should provide some baseline into
what is at these communities' disposal. I also want to collect data on traces of burning on the
forest floor or pieces of charred wood over a large area. I will also collect maps of the site and
surrounding area in order to plan potential geological features that might hinder or allow
deforesting distances.
How will the data be collected or created?
Files of compilated research from prior excavations and analysis of human practices in the
area. My own excavations marked in various distances from the bluff itself following
elevation and rock formations. Field notes taken during the excavations and maps marked with
each site and their deforestation status. Lab analysis of charcoal and/or wood fragments with
carbon dating from pieces recovered that could be tied to large scale burning over time. Files
will be titled according to each of the data types. Titles for prior works, tools/possible
deforesting practices, map catalogs, charcoal/wood fragments recorded and their lab results.
Documentation and Metadata
Ethics and Legal Compliance
How will you manage any ethical issues?
This research will be discusses with the Illinois Forest Service and park recreational
management by the city of Vienna and its park authorities. We will also contact NAGPRA
coordinators in order to obtain authorization to excavate in respect to indigenous remains and
their suggestions for handling in case of such discoveries. The data will be shared with the
Center for Archaeological Investigations in Carbondale to corroborate with prior studies and
comparison of artifacts.
How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IP/IPR)
issues?
Data with be available to the School of Anthropology at Southern Illinois University
Carbondale and its Center for Archaeology and uploaded to a school database along with the
research essay. This data does not fall under the seeking of patents or any publishing
restrictions.
Storage and Backup
How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?
Field notes will be transposed unto a text management software such as Obsidian after every
week of excavations as long as the service is in line with the institution and the funders. My
research assistant with compile the files and copy them to multiple flash drives amongst
ourselves as well as the data files being shared with each other from the text management
software.
How will you manage access and security?
Access to notes will be restricted to me and my research assistant as well as a central
repository in which the flash drives are stored and time in which they are removed is
accounted for.
Selection and Preservation
Which data are of long-term value and should be retained, shared, and/or
preserved?
Maps of the excavated sites and their status as potentially being deforested areas is to be
retained above all else. If this data and the method of collecting such is successful, then the
mapped data can be compared to future studies into other community deforestation patterns.
What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset?
The data will be archived through the Southern Illinois University Carbondale research
archives as well as being shared with catalogues in the Center for Archaeological
Investigations.
Data Sharing
How will you share the data?
This research will be shared with the School of Anthropology and submitted to their archives
as well as their attachment to the school library if deemed useful in their collections. Links to
the data archives will also be posted with the research essay connecting readers to the primary
data directly.
Are any restrictions on data sharing required?
Data will not be shared until after the research essay is finished and submitted to the School of
Anthropology, yet the links to the data will be valid at the discretion of university oversight.
Responsibilities and Resources
What resources will you require to deliver your plan?
Notebooks and flash drives will be needed for primary note taking and data compiling. Text
management and archive making tools may need payed access for their accounts depending on
the software we need. Contracting additional excavation workers will also be needed due to
the need for many excavation sites. Fees may also need be payed for lab results regarding the
charcoal/wood fragments and subsequent dating.
